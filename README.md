# trestlebot-demo-ssp
Testing and demonstrating trestlebot in various configurations for SSPs

# Example with a default main branch

- Automated pushes to main with updates

# What is missing

- SSP automated versioning update
- The develop branch. This example uses GitHub flow to keep it more lightweight.
- An automated dry-run option. It may be generally useful to know if a markdown changes is going to cause assemble to fail before it merged.


# TODO - SSP report generation (i.e using SSP filter in CI)
