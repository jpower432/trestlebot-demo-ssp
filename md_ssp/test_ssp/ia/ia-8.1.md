## Control Assessment Objective

## Control guidance

Acceptance of Personal Identity Verification (PIV) credentials from other federal agencies applies to both logical and physical access control systems.

The adequacy and reliability of PIV card issuers are addressed and authorized using [SP 800-79-2](#10963761-58fc-4b20-b3d6-b44a54daba03).
