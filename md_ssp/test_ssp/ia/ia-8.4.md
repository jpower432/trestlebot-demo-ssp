# ia-8.4 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Use of Defined Profiles

## Control Statement

Conform to the following profiles for identity management [identity management profiles].

## Control Assessment Objective

there is conformance with [identity management profiles] for identity management.

## Control guidance

Organizations define profiles for identity management based on open identity management standards. To ensure that open identity management standards are viable, robust, reliable, sustainable, and interoperable as documented, the Federal Government assesses and scopes the standards and technology implementations against applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines.
