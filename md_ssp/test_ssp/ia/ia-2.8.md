# ia-2.8 - \[Identification and Authentication\] Access to Accounts â€” Replay Resistant

## Control Statement

Implement replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to [Selection (one or more): privileged accounts; non-privileged accounts].

## Control Assessment Objective

replay-resistant authentication mechanisms for access to [Selection (one or more): privileged accounts; non-privileged accounts] are implemented.

## Control guidance

Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include protocols that use nonces or challenges such as time synchronous or cryptographic authenticators.

______________________________________________________________________

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

<!-- Add implementation prose for the main This System component for control: ia-2.8 -->

#### Implementation Status: planned

### ocp4

OpenShift offers support for replay-resistant authentication
mechanisms, both for OpenShift console and 3rd party
authentication. Third party identity providers configured for
modern TLS is supported by OpenShift.

Please see the specific identity provider documentation:
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/understanding-authentication.html

When using the LDAP provider, care must be taken to not set
the "insecure" flag so that TLS is used.

#### Rules:

  - ocp_no_ldap_insecure
  - idp_is_configured
  - ocp_idp_no_htpasswd

#### Implementation Status: implemented
