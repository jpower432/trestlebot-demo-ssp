# cp-4 - \[Contingency Planning\] Contingency Plan Testing

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Test the contingency plan for the system [frequency] using the following tests to determine the effectiveness of the plan and the readiness to execute the plan: [organization-defined tests].

- \[b.\] Review the contingency plan test results; and

- \[c.\] Initiate corrective actions, if needed.

- \[cp-4_fr\]

  - \[(a) Requirement:\] The service provider develops test plans in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-34 (as amended); plans are approved by the JAB/AO prior to initiating testing.
  - \[(b) Requirement:\] The service provider must include the Contingency Plan test results with the security package within the Contingency Plan-designated appendix (Appendix G, Contingency Plan Test Report).

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CP-04a.\]

  - \[CP-04a.[01]\] the contingency plan for the system is tested [frequency];
  - \[CP-04a.[02]\] [tests] are used to determine the effectiveness of the plan;
  - \[CP-04a.[03]\] [tests] are used to determine the readiness to execute the plan;

- \[CP-04b.\] the contingency plan test results are reviewed;

- \[CP-04c.\] corrective actions are initiated, if needed.

## Control guidance

Methods for testing contingency plans to determine the effectiveness of the plans and identify potential weaknesses include checklists, walk-through and tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel or full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Organizations conduct testing based on the requirements in contingency plans and include a determination of the effects on organizational operations, assets, and individuals due to contingency operations. Organizations have flexibility and discretion in the breadth, depth, and timelines of corrective actions.
