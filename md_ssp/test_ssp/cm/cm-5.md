# cm-5 - \[Configuration Management\] Access Restrictions for Change

## Control Statement

Define, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[CM-05[01]\] physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are defined and documented;

- \[CM-05[02]\] physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are approved;

- \[CM-05[03]\] physical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are enforced;

- \[CM-05[04]\] logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are defined and documented;

- \[CM-05[05]\] logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are approved;

- \[CM-05[06]\] logical access restrictions associated with changes to the system are enforced.

## Control guidance

Changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems or the operational procedures related to the system can potentially have significant effects on the security of the systems or individualsâ€™ privacy. Therefore, organizations permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes. Access restrictions include physical and logical access controls (see [AC-3](#ac-3) and [PE-3](#pe-3) ), software libraries, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (i.e., changes implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change windows (i.e., changes occur only during specified times).

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

<!-- Add implementation prose for the main This System component for control: cm-5 -->

#### Implementation Status: planned
