# sc-28.1 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Cryptographic Protection

## Control Statement

Implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the following information at rest on [system components or media]: [information].

- \[1_fr\]

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-28(01)[01]\] cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized disclosure of [information] at rest on [system components or media];

- \[SC-28(01)[02]\] cryptographic mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized modification of [information] at rest on [system components or media].

## Control guidance

Organizations should select a mode of protection that is targeted towards the relevant threat scenarios.

Examples:

A. Organizations may apply full disk encryption (FDE) to a mobile device where the primary threat is loss of the device while storage is locked.

B. For a database application housing data for a single customer, encryption at the file system level would often provide more protection than FDE against the more likely threat of an intruder on the operating system accessing the storage.

C. For a database application housing data for multiple customers, encryption with unique keys for each customer at the database record level may be more appropriate.

The selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to encrypt information on system components or media or encrypt data structures, including files, records, or fields.

### ocp4

The customer is responsible for implementing cryptographic
mechanisms to prevent unauthorzed disclosure and modification of
customer data.

When running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, full disk encryption
is possible for data at rest on the OpenShift nodes. For data
in transport, OpenShift uses cryptographic algorithms and ciphers to
protect confidentiality and integrity of data in transport.

Information about the state of the system is stored in etcd.
OpenShift has support for enabling etcd encryption [1], which
effectively protects the confidentiality and integrity of
the cluster's runtime and workload-related information at rest.
