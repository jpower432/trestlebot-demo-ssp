# sc-12 - \[System and Communications Protection\] Cryptographic Key Establishment and Management

## Control Statement

Establish and manage cryptographic keys when cryptography is employed within the system in accordance with the following key management requirements: [requirements].

- \[sc-12_fr\]

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SC-12[01]\] cryptographic keys are established when cryptography is employed within the system in accordance with [requirements];

- \[SC-12[02]\] cryptographic keys are managed when cryptography is employed within the system in accordance with [requirements].

## Control guidance

See references in NIST 800-53 documentation.

Must meet applicable Federal Cryptographic Requirements. See References Section of control.

Wildcard certificates may be used internally within the system, but are not permitted for external customer access to the system.

Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual procedures or automated mechanisms with supporting manual procedures. Organizations define key management requirements in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines and specify appropriate options, parameters, and levels. Organizations manage trust stores to ensure that only approved trust anchors are part of such trust stores. This includes certificates with visibility external to organizational systems and certificates related to the internal operations of systems. [NIST CMVP](#1acdc775-aafb-4d11-9341-dc6a822e9d38) and [NIST CAVP](#84dc1b0c-acb7-4269-84c4-00dbabacd78c) provide additional information on validated cryptographic modules and algorithms that can be used in cryptographic key management and establishment.

### ocp4

While OpenShift allows to provide a custom PKI for external-facing TLS
endpoints such as routes, there are far more internal-only trust stores
within OCP that contain self-signed CAs that cannot be replaced by an
outside CA. One example is the service-serving-ca, which creates
certificates only valid for the internal service network. [1] Other
examples include the node certificates [2], bootstrap certificates [3]
or the etcd certificates [4].

While the API Server certificates can't be replaced, it's possible to
add extra certificates that it will serve in case there's the need
for clients to have explicit trust for them. [5]

Even though it is not possible to replace the internal CAs such as
service-serving-ca with organizational CAs, all the issued certificates
are used for in-cluster communication only and not exposed outside
the cluster. In addition, the internal CAs create an implicit trust
boundary, because no outside certificates are valid for the internal
services.  Moreover, OpenShift is responsible for automatically rotating
both the certificates and the service CA.

separately and is being tracked with:
