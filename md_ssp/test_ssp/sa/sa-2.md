# sa-2 - \[System and Services Acquisition\] Allocation of Resources

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Determine the high-level information security and privacy requirements for the system or system service in mission and business process planning;

- \[b.\] Determine, document, and allocate the resources required to protect the system or system service as part of the organizational capital planning and investment control process; and

- \[c.\] Establish a discrete line item for information security and privacy in organizational programming and budgeting documentation.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SA-02a.\]

  - \[SA-02a.[01]\] the high-level information security requirements for the system or system service are determined in mission and business process planning;
  - \[SA-02a.[02]\] the high-level privacy requirements for the system or system service are determined in mission and business process planning;

- \[SA-02b.\]

  - \[SA-02b.[01]\] the resources required to protect the system or system service are determined and documented as part of the organizational capital planning and investment control process;
  - \[SA-02b.[02]\] the resources required to protect the system or system service are allocated as part of the organizational capital planning and investment control process;

- \[SA-02c.\]

  - \[SA-02c.[01]\] a discrete line item for information security is established in organizational programming and budgeting documentation;
  - \[SA-02c.[02]\] a discrete line item for privacy is established in organizational programming and budgeting documentation.

## Control guidance

Resource allocation for information security and privacy includes funding for system and services acquisition, sustainment, and supply chain-related risks throughout the system development life cycle.
