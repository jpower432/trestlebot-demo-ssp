# pe-15 - \[Physical and Environmental Protection\] Water Damage Protection

## Control Statement

Protect the system from damage resulting from water leakage by providing master shutoff or isolation valves that are accessible, working properly, and known to key personnel.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[PE-15[01]\] the system is protected from damage resulting from water leakage by providing master shutoff or isolation valves;

- \[PE-15[02]\] the master shutoff or isolation valves are accessible;

- \[PE-15[03]\] the master shutoff or isolation valves are working properly;

- \[PE-15[04]\] the master shutoff or isolation valves are known to key personnel.

## Control guidance

The provision of water damage protection primarily applies to organizational facilities that contain concentrations of system resources, including data centers, server rooms, and mainframe computer rooms. Isolation valves can be employed in addition to or in lieu of master shutoff valves to shut off water supplies in specific areas of concern without affecting entire organizations.
