# si-12 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Information Management and Retention

## Control Statement

Manage and retain information within the system and information output from the system in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines and operational requirements.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SI-12[01]\] information within the system is managed in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, and operational requirements;

- \[SI-12[02]\] information within the system is retained in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, and operational requirements;

- \[SI-12[03]\] information output from the system is managed in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, and operational requirements;

- \[SI-12[04]\] information output from the system is retained in accordance with applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, and operational requirements.

## Control guidance

Information management and retention requirements cover the full life cycle of information, in some cases extending beyond system disposal. Information to be retained may also include policies, procedures, plans, reports, data output from control implementation, and other types of administrative information. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) provides federal policy and guidance on records retention and schedules. If organizations have a records management office, consider coordinating with records management personnel. Records produced from the output of implemented controls that may require management and retention include, but are not limited to: All XX-1, [AC-6(9)](#ac-6.9), [AT-4](#at-4), [AU-12](#au-12), [CA-2](#ca-2), [CA-3](#ca-3), [CA-5](#ca-5), [CA-6](#ca-6), [CA-7](#ca-7), [CA-8](#ca-8), [CA-9](#ca-9), [CM-2](#cm-2), [CM-3](#cm-3), [CM-4](#cm-4), [CM-6](#cm-6), [CM-8](#cm-8), [CM-9](#cm-9), [CM-12](#cm-12), [CM-13](#cm-13), [CP-2](#cp-2), [IR-6](#ir-6), [IR-8](#ir-8), [MA-2](#ma-2), [MA-4](#ma-4), [PE-2](#pe-2), [PE-8](#pe-8), [PE-16](#pe-16), [PE-17](#pe-17), [PL-2](#pl-2), [PL-4](#pl-4), [PL-7](#pl-7), [PL-8](#pl-8), [PM-5](#pm-5), [PM-8](#pm-8), [PM-9](#pm-9), [PM-18](#pm-18), [PM-21](#pm-21), [PM-27](#pm-27), [PM-28](#pm-28), [PM-30](#pm-30), [PM-31](#pm-31), [PS-2](#ps-2), [PS-6](#ps-6), [PS-7](#ps-7), [PT-2](#pt-2), [PT-3](#pt-3), [PT-7](#pt-7), [RA-2](#ra-2), [RA-3](#ra-3), [RA-5](#ra-5), [RA-8](#ra-8), [SA-4](#sa-4), [SA-5](#sa-5), [SA-8](#sa-8), [SA-10](#sa-10), [SI-4](#si-4), [SR-2](#sr-2), [SR-4](#sr-4), [SR-8](#sr-8).

## What is the solution and how is it implemented?

<!-- For implementation status enter one of: implemented, partial, planned, alternative, not-applicable -->

<!-- Note that the list of rules under ### Rules: is read-only and changes will not be captured after assembly to JSON -->

### This System

<!-- Add implementation prose for the main This System component for control: si-12 -->

#### Implementation Status: planned

### ocp4

The customer will be responsible for handling and retaining
information within, or hosted by, OpenShift in
accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders,
directives, policies, regulations, standards, and operational
requirements.

This can be achieved with a combination of log forwarding [1]
and backing up the etcd datastore [2]. The appropriate retention
of the aforementioned data shall be ensured and determined by the customer.
