# si-5 - \[System and Information Integrity\] Security Alerts, Advisories, and Directives

## Control Statement

- \[a.\] Receive system security alerts, advisories, and directives from [external organizations] on an ongoing basis;

- \[b.\] Generate internal security alerts, advisories, and directives as deemed necessary;

- \[c.\] Disseminate security alerts, advisories, and directives to: [Selection (one or more): [personnel or roles]; [elements]; [external organizations]] ; and

- \[d.\] Implement security directives in accordance with established time frames, or notify the issuing organization of the degree of noncompliance.

- \[Requirement:\] Service Providers must address the CISA Emergency and Binding Operational Directives applicable to their cloud service offering per FedRAMP guidance. This includes listing the applicable directives and stating compliance status.

## Control Assessment Objective

- \[SI-05a.\] system security alerts, advisories, and directives are received from [external organizations] on an ongoing basis;

- \[SI-05b.\] internal security alerts, advisories, and directives are generated as deemed necessary;

- \[SI-05c.\] security alerts, advisories, and directives are disseminated to [Selection (one or more): [personnel or roles]; [elements]; [external organizations]];

- \[SI-05d.\] security directives are implemented in accordance with established time frames or if the issuing organization is notified of the degree of noncompliance.

## Control guidance

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness throughout the Federal Government. Security directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the responsibility and authority to issue such directives. Compliance with security directives is essential due to the critical nature of many of these directives and the potential (immediate) adverse effects on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not be implemented in a timely manner. External organizations include supply chain partners, external mission or business partners, external service providers, and other peer or supporting organizations.
