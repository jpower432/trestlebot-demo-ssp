# au-11 - \[Audit and Accountability\] Audit Record Retention

## Control Statement

Retain audit records for [time period] to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.

- \[au-11_fr\]

  - \[Requirement:\] The service provider retains audit records on-line for at least ninety days and further preserves audit records off-line for a period that is in accordance with NARA requirements.
  - \[Requirement:\] The service provider must support Agency requirements to comply with M-21-31 (https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/M-21-31-Improving-the-Federal-Governments-Investigative-and-Remediation-Capabilities-Related-to-Cybersecurity-Incidents.pdf)

## Control Assessment Objective

audit records are retained for [time period] to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.

## Control guidance

The service provider is encouraged to align with M-21-31 where possible

Organizations retain audit records until it is determined that the records are no longer needed for administrative, legal, audit, or other operational purposes. This includes the retention and availability of audit records relative to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, subpoenas, and law enforcement actions. Organizations develop standard categories of audit records relative to such types of actions and standard response processes for each type of action. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General Records Schedules provide federal policy on records retention.

#### Implementation Status: planned

### ocp4

The Red Hat OpenShift audit logs are emitted by the API servers
and stored on the master nodes.
The API servers do not support retaining audit logs for at least a
defined number of days, therefore the logs must be offloaded from
the cluster.

The Cluster Logging Operator is able to forward the Red Hat OpenShift
audit logs so that they can be stored per organizational policy.
